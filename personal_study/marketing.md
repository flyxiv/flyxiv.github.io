![marketing](../images/market1.png)

* Seller's Market: **Product Focused Market - Develop that product as best as possible.**
   * business focus: sell as much as you can - **profit = volume(market share)**
   * key consideration: **How to get growth? - new products based on experience? new markets?** 
   * inside-out

* Customer's Market: **How to make customers buy to me rather than competitors** - look at what "the customer wants"
   * outside-in
   * **Which Customer? - We can't satisfy everyone - PICK AND CHOOSE.** - Pick the target customer group and deliver exactly what that group wants.
   * **profit = value creation** - Not one transaction, we need to create value time after time after time - customer loyalty, constantly delivering value over time


## Market vs Customer Share
* Market share: try to get a little bit from everybody
* Customer share: A more narrow market - try to get more from each of those target customer's markets - loyalty

### Loyalty is profitable
* It is a cumulative result of delivering a group of user's needs consecutively
* First time figuring out needs and delivering is hard, but after that the iterations get easier.
* **Easier to retain customers than to add new ones**
* Not only sell one product, **cross sell around the already going-well product. - **Increasing customer share.**
```
ex) GAP or Jeans Shop: Also sell belt
```

## Globalization Changes the Market Place
* Not a 1-1 conversation(customer-producer) anymore - internet, social media, ... - customers can talk to customers
* Good and bad - they propagate good and the bad.
* Not only value, but **top-notch customer experience.**

### Customer Experience
* starts before the transaction, ends after the transaction
* ex) finding location, parking, buy, and then leaving - the entire process
* Marketer has to be **transparent, authentic, and think of all the customer experience.**

## Changes after the Recession
* People stopped trusting market
* Build trust based on authentic, trust, discipline genuine customer value. 
* Not only deliver customer value over time/experiential way,  -> **Cut costs and deliver value in discipline manner , flexible to change**

## 3 Principles of Marketing
1) Principle of Customer Value - Provide real, genuine customer value
2) Principle of Differentiation - Provide what the customer wants, but **better than your competition**
3) Principle of Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning - **Select specific group you want to satisfy**

## 4 P's of Marketing
1) Product - Seller puts in exchange
2) Place - Method of distribution.
3) Promotion - Way Seller communicates the benefits of product
4) Price - Buyer puts in exchange

* Also can be used in non-market ex) American Red Cross
1) Product: Little sticker 
2) Place: Blood mobile
3) Promotion: Missing class
4) Price: Blood

* Choose which of the three categories we will excel at and **be the first in the market to deliver that goal.**
* Depending on which category we chose, our hiring/resource/and other implications change greatly.
1) Figure out **how much of each category our market is able to differentiate**
2) Figure out **fair value of each category in our market. - market research**
   * In mature markets, many products are above fair value in all categories - hard to search
3) Where the competitors are in each axis.

Short term != Long term
* long term: excel Customer intimacy 
* short term: our Operational excellence is not fair value, so first prioritize in improving that.

## fair value
![marketing4](../images/market4.png)
* If you offer more benefits, customers are willing to pay higher price
* If you offer lower price, customers will expect fewer benefits, as long as what you offer **appears to be fair(it still has the key superior values)**
* We need to offer **fair value in two of these offers, but something better than fair value in one of the categories**

but of course, **competitors keeps advancing, so the cut for fair value and better than fair value keeps going up**
